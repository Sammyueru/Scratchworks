# Scratchworks [WIP]
# Steamworks for Scratch
Scratchworks is a steamworks extension for scratch (as the name implies)
Note: this extension works with TurboWarp (which uses Scratch's source code) not scratch itself

I'm is currently using Greenworks (https://github.com/greenheartgames/greenworks) as a base

More info coming soon!

Steps to using (Note that this extension still does not work):
1. Fork this repository
2. Add GitHub Pages to the main branch (in root)
3. Change "steam_appid.txt" contents to whatever your games Steam App ID is
4. Replace anywhere in scratchworks.js you see "https://sammyueru.github.io/Scratchworks" to whatever it would be with your GitHub Pages
5. Add the extension into TurboWarp as https://<your github username>.github.io/<whatever you called your repository>/scratchworks.js
6. Start adding Steamworks API features to your TurboWarp game!

OLD:
Extension URL (Copy into TurboWarp and add it as an extension): https://sammyueru.github.io/Scratchworks/scratchworks.js
